# Procivis One

Procivis One is a robust solution capable of powering every element of the digital identity
credential lifecycle — schema definition, credential design, issuance, holding, revocation,
suspension, updating and verifying digital credentials — and integrating them into business
processes through a range of integration pathways and deployments.

Handle credential-driven use cases and processes flexibly with an extensible configuration
that supports multiple credential formats, revocation methods, key types, signatures, and
DID methods. Procivis One is built to connect your organization to the SSI ecosystem, become
compatible with regulations such as **eIDAS 2.0**, and be extensible as new regulations and
requirements emerge.

## Procivis One Core

The [Procivis One Core](https://github.com/procivis/one-core) handles everything needed to
issue, hold and verify decentralized digital identity and credentials, and integrates into
business and IT applications via a RESTful API. Use the Procivis One Core to build components
for your own use case, or use one of the existing components built on the Core.
